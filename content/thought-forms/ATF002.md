You see

Words are powerful

Through them we can paint 

Landscapes and worlds of meaning

Convey and articulate ideas

Sustain and dismiss them

We can make friends

And enemies

Spread joy

And hate

Both amplify and calm emotions

So find your voice

The world needs our voices

Our ideas

Our perspectives

Our imagination

But choose your words wisely

For those who speak

Shoulder the weight of great responsibility

We owe them our gratitude

And our deep respect
