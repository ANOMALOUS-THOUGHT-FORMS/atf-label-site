Our experience is a dialogue

A negotiation with reality

A negotiation that constructs reality

It is a dialogue with ourselves

With the realms we inhabit

And the beings we encounter along the way

Through this negotiation

Through our actions and interactions

We weave the webs and worlds of meaning

That constitute our rich, textured and ever shifting experience

Not only that

We enact this reality

These worlds

Our actions and interactions

Make and remake

The worlds around us

And individuals

Form the atomised, autonomous agents of change

That drive the vast, intangible social edifices and structures

We build, sustain and evolve

That we orient our lives around

That we must learn to live in

Play with
