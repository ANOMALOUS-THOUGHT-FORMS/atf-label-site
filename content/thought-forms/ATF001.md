authorNote: "This poem was first written on a 7am flight to Geneva the Tuesday after Glastonbury Festival 2025. Sleep deprived but high on life and full of creativity. This poem attempts to articulate the enactive model for how our rich, intersubjective experience of reality is woven with meaning. After many earlier failed attempts to describe our lived experience, this poem poured out of me is one straight shot and remains virtually unchanged in this digital version. I am delighted with the result."

Our experience is a dialogue

A negotiation with reality

A negotiation that constructs reality

It is a dialogue with ourselves

With the realms we inhabit

And the beings we encounter along the way

Through this negotiation

Through our actions and interactions

We weave the webs and worlds of meaning

That constitute our rich, textured and ever shifting experience

Not only that

We enact this reality

These worlds

Our actions and interactions

Make and remake

The worlds around us

And individuals

Form the atomised, autonomous agents of change

That drive the vast, intangible social edifices and structures

We build, sustain and evolve

That we orient our lives around

And must learn to live in

Play with
